# III. Launch the System

## A. Prepare for the First Stat Meeting

Once the city has decided to take a more evidence based approach to management, architected the framework, and identified the initial datasets, the city is well on its way to implementing a performance management program.

The next step is to begin to analyze the data and prepare for the first stat meeting. At these meetings, department leads, the principal, and a panel of stakeholders will participate in a collaborative discussion of the data. This discussion is framed by analytics prepared by the stat analyst and the discussion is led either by the principal or the stat lead.

### The Role of the Stat Analyst
The stat analyst always has important work to do before every stat meeting. He or she provides the materials that guide the focus of the meeting. The stat analyst needs to pay attention to areas addressed in the strategic framework - keeping the legislative cycle, current events, and pressing administrative issues in mind.

Another important function the stat analyst performs to is to create charts, graphs, maps, and other visualizations which improves understanding of the data.

In addition, the analyst works with the stat lead to determine the priority areas for stat meetings. Before the first stat meeting, the analyst collects input from the department, after which time he or she reviews the indicator data relating to an issue or department and crafts a stat memo (see [Appendix A](appendix-a.md)).

### The Stat Meeting Memo

The analyst should work with the principal’s senior team (e.g., the mayor’s deputy chief of staff and leadership team) to develop a hierarchy of priorities that the performance management process will focus on as it begins. This initial focus should include input from department leadership, the goal owner (if applicable), the principal, and the stat director. The stat analyst drafts a memo for every stat meeting, based upon that hierarchy of priorities. These meetings should occur at least once a month per department and include all internal stakeholders. This means that those involved in the overall performance management program will likely attend multiple stat meetings per week, so that every department or issue receives a monthly review.

Here are guidelines for drafting a stat meeting memo (see [Appendix A](appendix-a.md) for a sample memo):

* **Memo Intro**: The beginning of the memo should include a list of the topics that will be covered in the meeting. This introduction sets out the organization, agenda, and flow of the meeting.

* **Topics to be Covered**: Each portion of the memo should have a title, a data visualization, and an estimate of how much time will be dedicated to the subject. The first topic in the memo, if the meeting is for a single department, should always be a review of the department’s indicator data that has been mapped and identified as informative of progress for the principal’s core goals. This is important because it allows the principal to reinforce the importance of the department, their work, and their data to the overall strategic framework.

* **Timing of the Meeting**: Different jurisdictions have different timing practices. 

 * Maryland’s StateStat program typically has between six to eight topics detailed in a single meeting memo. The amount of time spent on each ranges from five to 30 minutes. Regular meetings are always 90 minutes long. Having a finite time allotted for the meeting allows for predictable and easy scheduling.
 * The LouieStat team meets with each department every six to eight weeks to discuss goals and progress, with departments holding their own stat meetings in the interim to prepare for the full LouieStat meeting.
 * New Orleans BlightStat meetings were originally held twice a month due to the intensive need to reduce blight, with meetings then monthly after a year of the program.


* **Review of Data**: In general, the stat memo and analyses should be organized in the following way:
 1. Review of goals and related data
 1. Review of any outstanding follow-up issues prompted by the prior stat meetings
 1. Review of the operational data
 1. Review of the subject matter data
 1. Review of any overlapping operational or subject matter data

* **Essentials for Each Topic**: Each discussion topic in the stat memo should include the following elements:
 * Introductory Narrative: Introduces a particular topic and describes the data that was used in the analysis.
 * Data Visualization: A map, chart, graph, table, photograph, or any other visualization.
 * Data Source: The performance management team is never the source of the data; the department contact should provide the appropriate data source.
 * Leading Questions: The stat analyst should construct recommended questions for the stat panel to ask the department leader(s). These questions should help to further explain the data, should be based in analysis, and be well researched by the stat analyst.

### Distribution of the Stat Memo

Determining who gets the memo before the initial stat meeting depends on the goals of the program. In Maryland, the meeting memo was distributed to the panel only. The agency did not get a copy of the memo. In contrast, New Orleans’ BlightStat is much more narrowly focused and all agency participants receive information in advance and know how meetings will progress.

At the beginning of the meeting the department has an opportunity to open the discussion with an update or some news, but presentations are discouraged and the memo serves as the agenda for the discussion. The rationale behind the approach was that the stat panel wanted the department head to have a deep awareness of their data, their connection to the strategic or goal framework, and be prepared to discuss how the department was doing.

The stat panel also wanted to avoid having the department lead come to the meetings with a presentation that addresses the issues raised in the memo. The idea is that the memo serves as a basis for a conversation, not a presentation by the department lead. If the department knows what will be covered in the session, then there is a very real possibility that it will have a diminishing effect on the conversation style sought.

The main benefit realized by not sharing the memo prior to the session was that the department heads create internal stats in order to prepare for the stat session. This engagement is a sign that the process is taking hold within the department. These increased reviews of the data, internal to the department, were certainly an added value to the overall quality of the formal stat sessions. The department heads were typically well prepared.

Also, because the department heads prepared “blind,” the data received more attention, which helped to produce better analysis and encouraged more people to review and rely on the data. This effort strengthens the engagement of the department in the formal stat process.

## B. Host a Stat Meeting

Now that the city has its stat memo drafted, it is time to assemble the stat panel and have the first stat meeting.

### Who to Invite to a Stat Session

* **Principal**: The principal should always attend the first session to set the tone. It signals to the department that the performance management program is how it would be held accountable to its progress, and it is how the department will be managed. But more importantly, the principal’s attendance is confirmation that the process itself -the participants, the data, the dialogue- is important.

* **Chief of Staff**: The chief of staff or the operational supervisor of the department should always attend. It is important that the department leader sees his or her supervisor at the table. This will also help to confirm the importance of the process in the overall governance methodology of the administration.

* **Department Budget Analyst**: The budget analyst should attend. In many cities, there are independent budget departments responsible for assembling and administering the city’s budget. There is typically a budget analyst assigned to each department. That analyst should always be present at his or her assigned department session. This allows for continuity between the performance management process and the budget process. In turn, the stat analyst should always participate in the budget hearings and meetings for the department. The budget analysts can also provide background on how decisions around budget were made, what priorities were protected through the budget process in the past, and how decisions around the current budget are shaping up. They add enormous value and should be encouraged to participate in the performance management process.

* **Legal Counsel**: Always have legal counsel at the table; the principal’s own legal counsel is best. Avoid having the department’s attorney on the panel. The purpose of independent counsel on the stat panel is to expedite conversations where legal barriers are present or perceived to be present. 

* **Department Head**: The department head and key personnel should always be at the table. The stat team should rely on the department head to invite the correct people from their organizations. Having other staff at the meetings helps with the flow of the conversation. Many cities have at least ten department leaders at stat meetings with some departments bringing significantly more participants.

* **Additional Participants**: It is also important to invite frontline staff to observe some meetings. This helps illustrate the value of data collected and helps the stat panel stay connected to the barriers to progress that exist on the frontline. Any other management stakeholder should participate. The department’s data officer or data organizer should be present at all meetings.

### Guidelines for the Meeting

Keep in mind that these are not typically public meetings, particularly in the beginning. The session should be no more than 90 minutes and follow the same format every time. Being respectful of everyone’s time is very important. The session should be driven by the data. The department leader should always have an opportunity to start the meeting with good news, then get into areas of concern, and outputs of internal data analysis.

### Incorporating the Dashboard

If a performance management dashboard has been built for the principal to review how the departments are performing, it should always be the landscape for the beginning of the stat meeting. All the data visualizations and the data should be available in the room for on-the-fly analytics and discussion.

### Choose a Meeting Leader

The meeting should have a leader. When the principal is in the room, he or she should always lead the meeting. There should be a director or owner of the process that can lead the meeting in the absence of the principal. This person should have the authority to make decisions and the capacity to allocate resources or authorize the allocation of resources. This person should have direct access to the principal and this should be well known to the departments and department contacts.
