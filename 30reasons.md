## 30 Reasons to Implement a Stat Program in Your City

As mayor, city manager, or an executive of the city administration, you have no ambiguities about the fact that your residents will demand services ranging from public transportation, sanitation, safer streets, playgrounds, housing, clean water, economic development, emergency services to public utilities and even zoos. Inevitably, not only do residents demand service delivery they also care about the quality and quantity of the service.

As a result, of budget constraints and limited resources which have always existed, there is the need for prudent management practices to ensure that the cities achieve more with what they have. Inarguably, every resident’s request is important, but not all requests can be satisfied, so setting priorities and targets are necessary to improve service delivery for everyone. Hence, performance management has become important to hold managers accountable.

Cities across the country have embraced the concept of performance management otherwise referred to as PerformanceStat- a process of setting goals, identifying metrics, assessing performance, and evaluating employees’ performance and program outcomes to inform decision making. PerformanceStat is a continuous process where city government executives work with their staff to deliver results to city residents. Today, managers are focused on leveraging data, analysis, responsibility, discretion, and power to convene follow-ups to improve performance with the various stat models.
