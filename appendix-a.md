# Performance Management Principles


| Performance Management Principles | Example |
| --- |
| **Find Advocates**: It is very important for the principal to engage a wide variety of stakeholders in the process of articulating strategic goals. Be aware, some stakeholders are more challenging to motivate than others. The best way to build buy in for a new performance management program is to find advocates, both inside and outside government, to help gather energy and resources around the strategic framework. This is done by including them in goal setting. Done in isolation, this work will inevitably fail to gain traction. | **Durham, NC**: Each year, Durham hosts workshops to solicit resident input on their strategic goals. Ensuring that stakeholders both inside and outside government are invested in strategic goals allows for easier measurement and management work |
| **Be Realistic**: The principal must give perspective from the frontlines. If the strategic framework, goals, strategies, or data are disconnected from the realities of the day-to-day process, the framework will be ineffective. Establishing a feedback loop from the frontline service delivery levels helps give perspective. This is critical and should be done immediately. | **New York, NY**: CompStat was designed to insert data into policing, but also to get feedback on data accuracy and usefulness from frontline officers. Combining data and on-the-ground perspective increased CompStat’s usefulness and longevity. |
| **Engage the Frontlines**: The fastest and most effective way to reform is to identify internal champions for change. Very often in government, there is an incredible amount of positive energy and innovation that happens on the frontlines. There is also typically a mirrored level of energy and innovation at the top level of departments. In middle lies a level of career managers who have seen many leaders come and go. Because of their long-term commitment to working in city government, these managers are the most important element of lasting change, and for any progress to take hold, the principal and department leads must make decisions that are credible and get traction with these mid-level managers. A top-down, forced approach will rarely work when creating a performance management program. | **Louisville, KY**: Departments in Louisville engage in their own department stat meetings in between LouieStat meetings. These meetings help the department prepare for LouieStat meetings and also help staff at all levels engage with data and decision-making within the department. |
| **Choose Crosscutting Initiatives**: In this new economy, all governments will be forced to work with fewer resources and be creative. The city’s implementation of performance management can assist in facilitating this transformation, starting with the identification of crosscutting, multi-stakeholder goals. Often, departments duplicate efforts around similar subjects. If not coordinated, there can be duplication in how these programs are administered and funded. When a city brings departments together there are some natural ways programs and initiatives can be consolidated. Avoid creating a framework that will maintain the status quo and reflect government’s historic deference to silos and data hoarding. A city will see faster results and higher returns if all parties are working together and sharing resources. | **New Orleans, LA**: With more than 40,000 blighted properties in 2010, New Orleans needed to make reducing blight a crosscutting priority. To do that, the city set up BlightStat, coordinating the efforts of five departments to use data and combine their efforts and programs to eliminate blight. |
| **Stay Connected and Open**: All participants, inside and out of a city’s performance management team, must be confident that this is an ongoing process throughout which they will have an opportunity to contribute feedback. By allowing the public to participate in the process, the process itself is inherently improved. The principal should make strategic requests of stakeholders to engage the right thought leaders, and this engagement should play out in an open environment. | **Kansas City, MO**: All KCStat meetings are live tweeted by city communications staff who engage in a dialogue with stakeholders. By engaging the public in the stat process in real-time during meetings, Kansas City helps to ensure that its stat process continues to address city needs. |
