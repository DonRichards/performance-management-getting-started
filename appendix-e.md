**Focusing on the Right Questions**

One key issue that many organizations overlook is the ability of managers and staff within the organization to ask the right questions of their data. Collecting and analyzing data is critical, but without knowing what questions to ask and answer, analysis will occur haphazardly. This also reduces buy-in among staff and managers as analysis becomes less useful to daily work.
The questions below are general questions to guide managers and staff as they begin using performance management techniques regularly. Specific data and circumstances often dictate different and more specific questions, but these questions can help guide management decisions while more specific processes are built.

**Problem Identification**
* What led you to identify this as an area of focus?
* How did you know this was a problem? What evidence exists?
* Have you checked with other departments to see if they have additional information or perspective on this problem?
* Do you discuss this issue internally within your department?

Data Quality and Analysis
•	What data did you use to identify the problem and where did it come from?
•	Is this the best data point/metric to measure progress on this issue?
•	How did you analyze the data you have? What technique did you use?
•	Why did you choose that technique? Would other techniques yield different results?

Current Status 
•	What is the current status and what led you to this conclusion?
•	How would the status change if you considered other factors?

Questions here and below will likely take the bulk of performance meeting time. Questions above may be answered prior to the meeting, allowing deeper focus on actions during meetings.

Trends and targets
•	How has the status changed over time?
•	How did city action affect the trend?
•	Why has the trend persisted or been changed?
•	What is the projected trend for X period of time?
•	What is your goal/target? What is the goal/target based on?

Course Correction
•	What is the plan of action to address the problem?
•	Who is responsible for changing the course of action?
•	How will you measure progress and when will you report back?
•	What other stakeholders contribute to progress on this issue?

Following Up
•	Capture specific follow up items as they are discussed in the meeting, including who is responsible and when the item is “due”
•	What will you present for discussion at the next meeting?
•	How and when do you expect changes to occur?
