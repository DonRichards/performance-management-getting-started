# II. Define Goals and Measure Progress

## A. Set Short, Intermediate, and Long-Term Goals

Once the foundation is established, department leaders and other high-level actors must establish goals and define measurements of success for everyone involved.

Useful goals have the following elements:

* **Well Defined**: A city must address the strategies the department lead will employ to use resources most effectively and articulate how the department will improve services for its constituents. Some examples of specific goals are to reduce overtime, increase acres of land using cover crops, or reduce error rates in the administration of benefits.

* **Measurable**: A city must be able to measure results to show it has achieved its goals. Being able to align data with goals brings credibility to the city’s efforts.
Clear Timeframe: Giving each goal a timeline improves accountability, internally and externally. When developing a timeline, be sure to include time for reevaluation, progress reporting, and check-ins.

* **Citywide**: Goals that are citywide rather than focused on individual departments help a city avoid siloing and achieve results that improve the lives of residents.
The principal and department leads should develop short, intermediate, and long term goals that the performance management effort can achieve. These will be informed by the strategic priorities, as discussed above.

| Short Term Goals: The short term set of goals should be achievable within one to two years. |
| --- |
| Increase the number of parents who receive safe sleep training in hospitals by 15% within the next year |
| Increase the number of inmates who return to the community with an ID card by 30% within two years |
| Reduce pending placement population in juvenile detention by 30% within two years |
| Increase the number of farms using cover crops by 30% in the next 12 months |
| Increase the number of children visited by social workers by 15% in the next year |


| Intermediate Goals: These goals usually fit into a political term, achievable in two to four years. The intermediate goals are broader and contemplate more collaboration across city departments. |
| --- |
| Reduce unemployment by 25% by the next election |
| Reduce domestic violence crimes by 20% in the next three years |
| Increase the number of citizens who have health insurance by 10% within four years |

| Long Term Goals: These goals are more ambitious and would take four to 20 years to achieve. The most effective long term goals are driven by outcomes that are easily identified and of equally high value among government stakeholders and the public. These goals are most effective if they create a forcing mechanism for cross-department or multi-department collaboration. Setting goals that span Mayoral administrations demonstrates an unselfish commitment. |
| --- |
| Reduce violent crime by 20% within the next 10 years. |
| Decrease the infant mortality rate by 10% within the next 12 years. |
| Improve eighth grade reading and math test scores by 20% in the next 15 years. |
| Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2030. |

## B. Align Data to Goals

Once the principal and the department leads have settled on the strategic framework and have set goals, it is time to align data with the city’s goals. Throughout the data uploading process when historical data is transferred to performance management software or a dashboard, the performance management team will have the ability to map the data to both the goals the data supports, and the departments that are responsible for the activities that will advance those goals. The first data uploaded to the performance management dashboard will likely be what was gathered at the inception of this process. It should be data that already exists and is reasonably well organized.

It is important to introduce organization across goal areas during data collection. To help with this process, assume that most performance management data can be organized into one of two general categories: operational data and subject matter data.

* *Operational Data*: Operational data is typically collected across multiple organizations, such as financial or human resources data. 
* *Subject Matter Data*: Subject matter data tells leadership about the performance of various programs, such as average length of stay in juvenile detention or third grade reading test scores.

### Identify Output and Outcome Metrics, KPIs

Understanding the difference between an output measure and an outcome measure is important in developing meaningful goals.

* *Output measure*: measures a quantity, volume, or production value of data
* *Outcome measure*: measures impact that data has on a desired result

A city’s goals may have one prevailing metric, but several outcome metrics, that provide insight on how the government or department is performing relative to the prevailing metric.

### Selecting First Datasets

Once a city has identified its goals and the corresponding outcome measures, the city must next create data templates.

A city will upload a broad variety of data to map (to match up and align) to the outcome measures and goals. When possible, the first datasets should be organized by data type, typically in the following categories:

* Operational data
* Subject matter data
* Validating (external) data

#### Operational Data for Measuring Outcomes

There will always be some standard operational data that will be collected consistently across a city government. This operational data will most likely come from a centralized personnel system or financial management system.

These are high value datasets because they are usually collected across departments and are typically standardized. Because of this, they will be used frequently and relied upon when conducting analyses. These datasets should be prioritized when beginning to embark on performance management work. The following are examples of data to include:

* Budget spend or burn rate
* Personnel hours: leave earned and used, scheduling
* Workforce demographics
* Open and filled positions

Please see our Data Set Starter Kit for additional data sets to consider.

#### Subject Matter Data for Measuring Outcomes

There should also be subject matter data used to measure outcomes. Subject matter data measures program performance, evaluates performance of key functionality, and gives city leadership an indication of how the broad arms of the organization are working together to produce outcomes.

Often this is the data serves as a prevailing metric or a critical indicator that is tracked closely with the city’s goals. By way of example, some subject matter metrics for public safety goals are found in:

* Offender case management systems
* Localized crime data
* Court processing data
* Warrants
* Serious offender tracking data, if different from the aforementioned offender case management system

#### Validating Data for Measuring Outcomes

Validating data is data that is recognized as the standard, or that by its nature, is endorsed publically as the key metric for specific measures. The following are common examples of validating data:

* **Unemployment Rate**: In this changing economy, most governments are focused on employment and use the unemployment rate as a bellwether for economic recovery. This information is provided in a dataset from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is universally used as benchmark employment data.
* **Crime Rate**: The Uniform Crime Reports (FBI) are used domestically as the standard for measuring crime from the national level to the local level.
* **Educational Test Scores**: Scores from standardized tests are frequently used to measure average student achievement and readiness. These can be local or national tests and provide prevailing data for a particular jurisdiction’s education systems.

#### Mapping Data to Outcomes

Once the data is identified and uploaded, it is time to map the data to outcomes. This requires creating a consistent taxonomy across all measured units or departments of the organization. A taxonomy organizes the process of measuring results in the following way:
1. Priority
1. Goal or Outcome
1. Key Performance Indicator
1. Metrics

Here is an example of an applied taxonomy:
1. Public Safety
1. Reduce Violent Crime by 20% by 2015
1. UCR (FBI) Violent Crime Data
1. Number of Open Warrants, Number of Inmates, Crimes Committed, Domestic Violence Crimes, Visits of Probation Officers for Serious Offenders, Technical Violation of Parole or Probation, etc.
