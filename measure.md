##Identify Metrics and KPIs

Understanding the difference between an output metric and an outcome metric is important in developing meaningful goals.

* *Output metric* measures a quantity, volume, or production value of data
* *Outcome metric* measures impact that data has on a desired result

A cityâ€™s goals should have one prevailing outcome metric, known as a [Key Performance Indicator (KPI)](glossary.md), and may have several additional metrics that provide insight on how the government or department is performing relative to the KPI.
