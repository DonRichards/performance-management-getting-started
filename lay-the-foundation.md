## Gather a Team and Data

So how to begin? It is good to gather key players and engage them right at the start. A city needs certain people to lead with a bird’s-eye view of the entire initiative, while others will focus on the day-to-day details of the data. Think of this as an opportunity to share with staff the reason for the shift to performance management, and some examples of how performance management has worked for other cities.

The following list provides a description of each key player:
Principal: The mayor, city manager, or any other (typically elected or appointed) leader who has the desire to manage a government or a branch of a government utilizing an evidence based approach.

* **Department Lead**: The department head or division administrator who owns the data that is being utilized to measure progress. This person is ultimately accountable to the principal for making progress on shared goals or a strategic plan. There may be multiple department leads.

* **Stat Lead**: An appointed member of the principal’s team that is responsible for overseeing the departments through the performance management process. This person must have credibility with department leaders and direct access to the principal and his or her senior team. This position is akin to a city’s chief operating officer or a mayor’s deputy chief of staff - someone with the gravitas to make things happen.

* **Stat Analyst**: The person responsible for collecting and managing the data used in the performance management program, and preparing analyses and reports of department data. (See Appendix C for a sample stat analyst job description.)

* **Department Contact**: A person on a department leader’s team, ranging from a database manager to chief of staff, who has the best information related to the metadata, the current use of the data, and the general value and quality of the data. This person may already exist if the department has a chief data officer or a director of research on the team.The department contact is responsible for shepherding the data including curating the data and ensuring that it is clean and in compliance with the metadata. This person will be the main point of contact for the stat team and will play a critical role in making sure the performance management program is a success.

* **Data Experts**: Other key participants in this preliminary conversation are geographic information system (GIS) professionals, database administrators, department staff with “analyst” or “research” in their title, and internal auditors. These are the people in a city department who manage data or otherwise know where data lives. These individuals are likely not currently working together on a consistent, coordinated, or regular basis. Many cities are not tapping into their analytical capability, and the exercise of identifying data experts can be a first step to deepening a city’s bench.

* **Public**: For successful performance management programs, the public is an important end user. Public use of stat generally occurs in three broad forms:
 * A user seeking services or general information
 * Press or non-profit organizations seeking details or context for government data to support the writing of an article or grant application
 * A developer who wants to understand the capacity of the data

### Conducting a Data Inventory

Once the team has been identified, the stat analyst will lead the effort to collect and track data. The first step is to create a data inventory, which is a crucial step to support goal setting. If a city has an existing set of priorities or a strategic framework, use it to guide the data collection process by prioritizing the datasets that are related to the priorities, and the departments that may own the data. 

The stat analyst should set up a meeting with the department lead and his or her leadership team, as well as the data experts mentioned above. Prior to this first meeting, a city should ask the invitees to come to the table with any data they own or know that the department is collecting. Many will not see themselves as data owners or managers, so it is critically important to help them understand what is meant by “data.” These types of questions can help with data collection and discovery before the meeting:

1. Do you provide information for reports on federal, state, or nonprofit grants?
1. Do you manage a database?
1. Do you compile reports for a legislative body (city council or cabinet meeting)?
1. Does your department have a strategic plan or any other key performance objectives?
1. Is your organization under any oversight from state or federal agencies, external auditors, or investigators? Is there a corrective action plan?
1. Do you already have a performance-based budgeting or evaluation program?

> **Las Vegas, NV**

> Traffic safety is a priority for the Las Vegas community. In 2014, the city reduced the number of automobile accidents at targeted intersections by 23 percent when it re-engineered the 50 intersections with the most crashes in a specific year. Additionally, Las Vegas reduced traffic delays by at least 25 percent at 25 of the 50 Most Congested Intersections. The city achieved these results by using data and evidence to drive decision making.
