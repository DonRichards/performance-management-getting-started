##Questions for Discussion: Getting the Right Goals

Has the city established overarching priorities through a strategic planning process, business plan, long-term goal statement, or some other way? List the priorities and any supporting documentation. Think about planning processes, legislation, initiatives, and speeches.

Has the city established long term, short term, or interim goals that are associated with your priorities? 

If so, are there metrics and a timelines associated with the goals? Can any of these be considered a bold goal? Have you identified a Key Performance Indicator (KPI)?

If not, brainstorm about what a bold goal might look like for each priority, including timeline, metrics, and KPI.

Which departments are responsible for the strategies to meet these goals? Do these departments have their own work plans to achieve the goals? 

If there are not yet citywide goals, have any departments established their own missions or goals? Could these be linked to the Citywide priorities?

Is the data associated with your priorities and goals easily available for the city to tap into? Is there county, state, or federal data that would be applicable to the goals you want to achieve? If you need to gather datasets, which departments would you prioritize? Who would do this work?

Are there any upcoming opportunities to communicate the data and goals? Can the data you collect be linked to public demand? How closely does your data align to the strategic goals the city wants to achieve?
