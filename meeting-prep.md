##Prepare for the First Stat Meeting
Once the city has decided to take a more evidence based approach to management, architected the framework, and identified the initial datasets, the city is well on its way to implementing a performance management program.

The next step is to begin to analyze the data and prepare for the first stat meeting. At these meetings, department leads, the principal, and a panel of stakeholders will participate in a collaborative discussion of the data. This discussion is framed by analytics prepared by the stat analyst and the discussion is led either by the principal or the stat lead.

###The Role of the Stat Analyst
The stat analyst always has important work to do before every stat meeting. He or she provides the materials that guide the focus of the meeting. The stat analyst needs to pay attention to areas addressed in the strategic framework - keeping the legislative cycle, current events, and pressing administrative issues in mind.
Another important function the stat analyst performs to is to create charts, graphs, maps, and other visualizations which improves understanding of the data.

In addition, the analyst works with the stat lead to determine the priority areas for stat meetings. Before the first stat meeting, the analyst collects input from the department, after which time he or she reviews the indicator data relating to an issue or department and crafts a stat memo .


###The Stat Meeting Memo
The stat analyst drafts a memo for every stat meeting, based upon that hierarchy of priorities. 
Here are guidelines for drafting a stat meeting memo (see [Appendix B](appendix-b.md) for a sample memo).

**Memo Intro:** The beginning of the memo should include a list of the topics that will be covered in the meeting. This introduction sets out the organization, agenda, and flow of the meeting.

**Topics to be Covered:** Each portion of the memo should have a title, a data visualization, and an estimate of how much time will be dedicated to the subject. The first topic in the memo, if the meeting is for a single department, should always be a review of the department’s indicator data that has been mapped and identified as informative of progress for the principal’s core goals. This is important because it allows the principal to reinforce the importance of the department, their work, and their data to the overall strategic framework.

**Review of Data:** In general, the stat memo and analyses should be organized in the following way:
1. Review of goals and related data
2. Review of any outstanding follow-up issues prompted by the prior stat meetings
3. Review of the operational data
4. Review of the subject matter data
5. Review of any overlapping operational or subject matter data

**Essentials for Each Topic:** Each discussion topic in the stat memo should include the following elements:
Introductory Narrative: Introduces a particular topic and describes the data that was used in the analysis.

**Data Visualization:** A map, chart, graph, table, photograph, or any other visualization.

**Data Source:** The performance management team is never the source of the data; the department contact should provide the appropriate data source.
Leading Questions: The stat analyst should construct recommended questions for the stat panel to ask the department leader(s). These questions should help to further explain the data, should be based in analysis, and be well researched by the stat analyst.

###Distribution of the Stat Memo
Determining who gets the memo before the initial stat meeting depends on the goals of the program. In Maryland, the meeting memo was distributed to the panel only. The agency did not get a copy of the memo. In contrast, New Orleans’ BlightStat is much more narrowly focused and all agency participants receive information in advance and know how meetings will progress. 
At the beginning of the meeting the department has an opportunity to open the discussion with an update or some news, but presentations are discouraged and the memo serves as the agenda for the discussion. The rationale behind the approach was that the stat panel wanted the department head to have a deep awareness of their data, their connection to the strategic or goal framework, and be prepared to discuss how the department was doing.
The stat panel also wanted to avoid having the department lead come to the meetings with a presentation that addresses the issues raised in the memo. The idea is that the memo serves as a basis for a conversation, not a presentation by the department lead. If the department knows what will be covered in the session, then there is a very real possibility that it will have a diminishing effect on the conversation style sought.
The main benefit realized by not sharing the memo prior to the session was that the department heads create internal stats in order to prepare for the stat session. This engagement is a sign that the process is taking hold within the department. These increased reviews of the data, internal to the department, were certainly an added value to the overall quality of the formal stat sessions. The department heads were typically well prepared.
Also, because the department heads prepared “blind,” the data received more attention, which helped to produce better analysis and encouraged more people to review and rely on the data. This effort strengthens the engagement of the department in the formal stat process.
