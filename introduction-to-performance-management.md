## An Introduction to Performance Management

Until recently, governments made decisions largely based on instinct, anecdotal evidence, and politics. They lacked the time and resources needed to fully review the outcomes of various programs. However, the public sector is shifting toward governing with data thanks to improvements in technology, data collection, and the rise of performance management programs that emphasize the benefits of data-informed decision making. Forward-thinking governments are optimizing the power of data to create greater efficiency and better results for residents.

Cities across the US are seeing real success with implementing performance management programs, and some of the results are highlighted throughout this guide.

> **New Orleans, LA**

> In 2011, Mayor Landrieu, with the support of the city council, created the Office of Performance and Accountability (OPA). OPA’s mission is to promote better city services by incorporating data and evidence in management, decision making, and accountability to improve residents’ lives.
BlightStat, a program to reduce blight within New Orleans, has achieved success by identifying data trends and making adjustments where necessary, including prioritizing the code enforcement process. In 2010, there were an estimated 43,755 blighted residences in the community. In just three years with the knowledge gained through BlightStat, New Orleans has:
* Reduced inspection times from 160 days to 80 days
* Reduced blight by **10,000** units
* Collected **$3.4** million in foreclosure liens
* Helped **440** low-income families receive financial assistance to bring their residences up to city housing code

Although there are a variety of performance management systems, including Lean and Six Sigma, “Stat” is one performance management tool that cities across the country have used to drive increases in performance. Each city customizes its stat program to its needs, but stat programs almost always include public political commitment to defined goals, continuous measurement and review of data, regular meetings with senior officials to take stock of progress, and ongoing action based on the data being tracked. These elements combine to create a system that encourages commitment, measurement, collaboration, action, and accountability.

Performance management helps government entities use technology and data to openly set goals, hold participants accountable, connect to stakeholders, track progress, and achieve results. By linking data to overarching priorities, collecting and analyzing data and evidence, and determining the desired outputs and outcomes, city leaders can use performance management to best administer policies and programs to the benefit of their community and residents.

## Launching a Performance Management Program

When launching a performance management program, a city should consider a variety of key questions. Who should be involved? What goals are most appropriate to be the focus of the performance management system? Answering these questions will help a city to design an effective performance management program.

> **Fort Lauderdale, FL**

> By actively checking in with residents, Fort Lauderdale is able to better allocate resources and meet resident needs.
After residents weighed in on capital spending priorities in its 2013 annual neighborhood survey, Fort  Lauderdale developed a multiyear stormwater management plan. In 2013, 64 percent of respondents saw an increase in flooding and only 27 percent reported being satisfied  with the city’s prevention of  stormwater−related flooding. The 2014 survey revealed that  52 percent of respondents saw an increase in flooding and 31 percent of respondents were satisfied with stormwater-related  flooding prevention.

Building organizational culture around the use of data will be important to ensure that employees across the organization at all levels understand and use performance management principles effectively. In order to adopt these practices in depth, cities will often need assistance, coaching, and training on appropriate strategies to engage employees at all levels of government. GovEx infuses services throughout its engagements to help cities think through culture change when building performance management systems.

Following is an outline of the actions a city should take to implement a successful stat performance management program:

>* Lay the foundation
    * Identify citywide priorities
    * Gather a team and data
* Define goals and measure progress
    * Set short, intermediate, and long-term goals
    * Align data to goals
* Launch the system
    * Prepare for the first stat meeting
    *  Host a stat meeting

This guide breaks each steps into actions, discusses key strategies to consider for implementation, and provides discussion questions to help cities determine next steps that are appropriate in their specific context.
