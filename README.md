Introduction to Performance Management
=======

Until recently, governments made decisions largely based on instinct, anecdotal evidence, and politics. They lacked the time and resources needed to fully review the outcomes of various programs. However, the public sector is shifting toward governing with data thanks to improvements in technology, data collection, and the rise of performance management programs that emphasize the benefits of data-informed decision making. Forward-thinking governments are optimizing the power of data to create greater efficiency and better results for residents.

Government performance management has gained popularity at the local level. Cities across the US are seeing real success with implementing performance management programs, and some of the results are highlighted in shaded boxes throughout the document.


> New Orleans, LA

> In 2011, Mayor Landrieu, with the support of the city council, created the Office of Performance and Accountability (OPA). OPA’s mission is to promote better city services by incorporating data and evidence in management, decision making, and accountability to improve residents’ lives.
BlightStat, a program to reduce blight within New Orleans, has achieved success by identifying data trends and making adjustments where necessary, including prioritizing the code enforcement process. In 2010, there were an estimated 43,755 blighted residences in the community. In just three years with the knowledge gained through BlightStat, New Orleans has:
* Reduced inspection times from 160 days to 80 days
* Reduced blight by 10,000 units
* Collected $3.4 million in foreclosure liens
* Helped 440 low-income families receive financial assistance to bring their residences up to city housing code


Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Government Excellence (GovEx) created this getting started guide to assist cities in implementing performance management programs in their own communities. By learning from the experiences of other cities and following the steps described in this guide, cities will have a greater understanding of performance management and be well on their way to launching their own performance management program.

Although there are a variety of performance management systems, including Lean and Six Sigma, “Stat” is one performance management tool that cities across the country have used to drive increases in performance. Each city customizes its stat program to its needs, but stat programs almost always include public political commitment to defined goals, continuous measurement and review of data, regular meetings with senior officials to take stock of progress, and ongoing action based on the data being tracked. These elements combine to create a system that encourages commitment, measurement, collaboration, action, and accountability.

In an increasingly tech-savvy and connected world, government performance is closely watched. Performance management helps government entities use technology and data to openly set goals, hold participants accountable, connect to stakeholders, track progress, and achieve results. By collecting and analyzing data and evidence, determining the desired outputs and outcomes, and linking data to overarching priorities, city leaders can use performance management to best administer policies and programs to the benefit of their community and residents.
