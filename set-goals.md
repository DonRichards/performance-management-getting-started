# Define Goals and Measure Progress

## Set Short, Intermediate, and Long-Term Goals

Once the foundation is established, department leaders and other high-level actors must establish goals and define measurements of success for everyone involved.

Useful goals have the following elements:

* **Well Defined**: A city must address the strategies the department lead will employ to use resources most effectively and articulate how the department will improve services.

* **Measurable**: A city must be able to measure results to show it has achieved its goals. A measurable goal includes targets, metrics, and timelines, which improves accountability internally and externally.

* **Citywide**: Goals that are citywide rather than focused on individual departments help a city avoid siloing and achieve results that improve the lives of residents.
The principal and department leads should develop short, intermediate, and long term goals that the performance management effort can achieve. These will be informed by the strategic priorities, as discussed above.

| Short Term Goals: The short term set of goals should be achievable within one to two years. |
| --- |
| Increase the number of parents who receive safe sleep training in hospitals by 15% within the next year |
| Increase the number of inmates who return to the community with an ID card by 30% within two years |
| Reduce pending placement population in juvenile detention by 30% within two years |
| Increase the number of farms using cover crops by 30% in the next 12 months |
| Increase the number of children visited by social workers by 15% in the next year |


| Intermediate Goals: These goals usually fit into a political term, achievable in two to four years. The intermediate goals are broader and contemplate more collaboration across city departments. |
| --- |
| Reduce unemployment by 25% by the next election |
| Reduce domestic violence crimes by 20% in the next three years |
| Increase the number of citizens who have health insurance by 10% within four years |

| Long Term Goals: These goals are more ambitious and would take four to 20 years to achieve. The most effective long term goals are driven by outcomes that are easily identified and of equally high value among government stakeholders and the public. These goals are most effective if they create a forcing mechanism for cross-department or multi-department collaboration. Setting goals that span Mayoral administrations demonstrates an unselfish commitment. |
| --- |
| Reduce violent crime by 20% within the next 10 years. |
| Decrease the infant mortality rate by 10% within the next 12 years. |
| Improve eighth grade reading and math test scores by 20% in the next 15 years. |
| Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2030. |
