# Exercise A
This summer, Springfield has had a series of armed robberies near the local university, which is less populated that during the school year, and residents have expressed their concerns in a series of Community Town Hall meetings. Some residents have even pointed out that public safety was part of the visioning exercise and resulting report from the previous summer, and that "nothing has been done about it." The report did declare that Springfield would reduce crime.

How can Springfield begin to tackle its crime problem? Think about focusing in on the problem.



# Exercise B
Georgetown has an internal performance management program that focuses on human resources metrics, such as percent of overtime and time lost due to workers compensation. The city is concerned that releasing the data used to track progress on these goals to the open data portal may result in negative reporting about certain departments.

What should Georgetown consider when deciding whether to release the data that it usese to make human resources and funding decisions?



# Exercise C
In Salem, the homeless population has high visibility on the streets and in homeless encampments beneath an underpass. There is a strong, vocal community of nonprofit anti-homeless advocates and service providers that the city funds on an annual basis, without seeing results. Everyone knows about the issue, and the city has set a goal to reduce homelessness 20% by 2020, but the nonprofits continue to work toward their own goals.

How can Salem work with stakeholders to reduced homelessness 20% by 2020?
