Is there data easily available for the city to tap into? Is there county, state, or federal data that would be applicable to the goals you want to achieve? If you need to gather datasets, which departments would you prioritize? Who would do this work?

Are there any upcoming opportunities to communicate the data and goals? Can the data you collect be linked to public demand? How closely does your data align to the strategic goals the city wants to achieve?
