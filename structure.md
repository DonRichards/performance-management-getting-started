Performance Management meetings can take multiple forms, depending on the frequency and focus of the meeting. The questions below are meant to guide cities in thinking through what their meeting structure might look like.

The meetings are critical to setting the tone around the importance of the performance targets, to keep the citywide goals top of mind, and to keep momentum going as those at the table work to identify trends and solve problems.

When setting up performance meetings, ensure that the meeting schedule is frequent enough to move the needle on the targets; regularly recurring; public, even if the meetings are not open to the public; and led by the city's chief executive and/or designatees.

Below are some questions to help determine the structure of performance management meetings:

<h5>Will your Chief Executive (Mayor or City Manager) lead each meeting?
If not, who will be their designee?</h5>
*Even if the Chief Executive will not be present at each meeting, leaving a place at the table or even a name plate for them can send the message that the meetings are a priority. In Louisville, Mayor Greg Fischer attends each [LouieStat](http://louiestat.louisvilleky.gov/) meeting.*

<h5>Will the meetings focus on a subject matter area, internal departmental operations, or both?</h5>
*ChattaData meetings are focused on the City's [performance priorities](https://performance.chattanooga.gov/).*

*In Maryland's StateStat, each State department had a Stat meeting once a month. Follow up items from the previous month were discussed, as well as new topics and trends. These meetings were complemented by quarterly "subject matter stats," in which all agencies that have ownership of certain topics were present.*

<h5>How frequently will the meetings occur?</h5>
*Frequency is important to keep the momentum going. Holding meetings at regular, publicly posted intervals helps build trust with residents by building in accountability.
Kansas City releases its [KCStat schedule](http://kcmo.gov/kcstat/meetings/) for the following year at the end of the previous year.*
